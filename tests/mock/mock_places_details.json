        "text": "Honestly unreal how delicious the food and drinks were. This was our first time checking out cafes in this area and I was drawn here by Google photos of the iced drinks and croffles, we are so delighted we chose to go here!\n\nOriginally I expected to start with sweet croffles and coffee and head somewhere else for savory breaky, but I was pleasantly surprised to see they had savory offerings as well. We chose the eggs Benedict croffle and caramel banana croffles with two iced Farben lattes and everything was perfection. It was so good we came back the next day for another Benedict croffle, this time also trying their eggplant bacon pizza (very thin crust but super flavorful!), iced caramel latte and iced orange latte (seasonal). Again, everything was spectacular. Their croffles and iced drinks are the best I‚Äôve ever had, can‚Äôt recommend this chill & friendly spot enough!\n\nFor access, we went to the 3rd floor cafe for both visits. They had a sandwich board in front the staircase to the cafe/bar space so it was pretty easy to find. Once inside, we ordered via QR code at the table which had an English option so it was super simple to navigate.",

The restaurant wasn't full, but I guess they limited the entry so that the kitchen could cope. As this was an American style cafe, you can expect the usual waffles, pancakes etc, there are also other variety of breakfast-type of food available. I am not very impressed with their house blend coffee which was supposed to be originated from Hawaii. The French toast was good though. The portion for the pancake was huge, I recommend sharing.

The menu was varied with breakfast and lunch options. I chose a poke bowl, and asked for it without the egg yolk which was no problem. My friend got the chocolate chip pancakes which was a massive portion and she asked for no cream which was also no issue (the amount of cream on the pancakes is a little crazyüòÇ). My only small issue was that they had no other varieties of milk (almond, soy, etc) so I wasn‚Äôt able to enjoy a coffee but that wasn‚Äôt really a big deal for me.

It‚Äôs nice to have a spot in Osaka that has a typical Sunday brunch vibe all day long, and I‚Äôm a big fan of their endless list of drinks haha\n\nThe potatoes are very good be sure to order them! I like their spinach cheddar omelet, just be aware they use quite a bit of oil so be aware if you‚Äôre sensitive to oil heavy foods. I also really like their chicken and waffle, or the platter on the back of the menu that gives you a sample of all the meats! Also tried the loco moco for the first time and the flavor was really good! Again, a lot of oil is used and that‚Äôs the only reason I gave a 4/5 stars!",

        "text": "While the place is very quaint and quite picturesque, we came here primarily for the coffee, and as such, this review only reflects our view of their coffee.\n\nWe felt that their coffee was just alright and nothing really special. There are other places not too far from this place that serves better tasting coffee. However, this does not mean that everything else they offer is not great. We only got their unbaked cheesecake other than our coffees and it was actually pretty good. And I‚Äôm sure other things in their menu, like the crepe, will be good. But I would say the coffee is more of a secondary supplement to their other offerings.\n\nAs for the place and ambience, it is probably one of the main reasons it attracts a ton of visitors. It is  picturesque, and the outside does not look like any typical cafe. The inside decor is rustic and unique, giving visitors a lot of chances for great coffee pictures.",

A gorgeously constructed and decorated little shop in the quiet side streets of Osaka - the lineup was decent but definitely worth it regardless of dine-in or take away. I got the pork katsu sando and my partner opted for the crepe. Both dishes were amazing but the crepes were truly next level. Such a cute place, incredible eats and drinks and amazing service. Highly recommend!!!",

There are numerous convenience stores nearby also which was handy.\nThe staff were excellent, we needed to send our luggage onto Hiroshima and they were extremely helpful in arranging this even calling the hotel there to ensure all the details were correct.

        "text": "Great location if you want to be close to entertainment and shops but far enough from the crowds. The room was great, plenty of space to open two medium sized travel suitcases. The bathroom was different from all the other 3 hotels I stayed at in Japan, the one I had included a standing shower next to a bathtub and you can choose what you prefer. You can get used to it pretty quickly after figuring out how to use the shower knob. The toilet and sink were all separate from the bath area. Like most Japanese hotels, you get toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, hairbrushes, razorblades and shaving cream, etc included, and you can restock everyday if needed. There were only 2 coin laundry machines, making it hard to do laundry at night (when most people are back in the hotel), but afternoon worked just fine for me. You can choose between a Japanese and a more western style breakfast, both were savory. Both were okay, but nothing too fancy (soup and small fish bites or sandwich). You can also get breakfast at Umeda station, it is 10 min away walking and it has many options to choose from. There are also several convenience stores nearby the hotel open until late. The breakfast lounge is pretty comfortable and has a nice atmosphere.",

Very poor water pressure at the sink. Room View is really magic. Building site between two large parking lots and noise from those places at midnight but at 5am as well.\nBreakfast was has very poor options so this just another awfull japanese hotel with small rooms, bad breakfast and lot of quirks.\nAt least they had rainbow and tranformer flags everywhere.\nI wish they invest energy spent on the lgbfjb decorations in really important things like services and rooms.\nAt least i know what is really important to the management.\nI get it.",

The location is great‚Äîjust a few minutes‚Äô walk from the main train station and close to one of the biggest Uniqlo stores.\n\nThe coffee is amazing! I tried the Iced Nola with both regular milk and oat milk, and for some reason, I think it tastes better with regular milk. Highly recommend giving it a try!\n\nThe atmosphere is super nice, with seating on both floors. The second floor has a cool space with a projection ceiling, and there are also window seats where you can watch the trains go by.\n\nThe staff are also super nice and speak English quite well, which makes ordering easy.\n\nOverall, just an amazing experience! Definitely worth a visit.",

        "text": "A short walk away from the busy Umeda Station shopping area, Nakazakicho is a quiet oasis. We chanced upon a charming cafe located in a traditional building at the end of a short alleyway. We ordered a Tanuki cake, a strawberry sponge cake,  lemon squash, and yuzu squash. Tanuki Cake is a Japanese shortcake that resembles a Japanese raccoon dog. We had it for the first time, and it was very delicious with dark chocolate and a filling inside that we couldn't identify.\n\nThe strawberry sponge cake was also very good. The freshly made drinks were very refreshing on a hot day. The cafe has a bohemian feel. On the upper floor, we noticed a tatami room that was occupied by families with little toddlers. It was almost like a nursery. I would recommend walking around the neighbourhood after having a snack at Cafe Taiyo. Nakazakicho is a quiet and quaint neighbourhood, quite a world away from Umeda.",
